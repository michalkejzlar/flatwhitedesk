Flat White Desk Android application - proof of concept created on MIPIM #hackrealestate hackathon.

## What is it for?
This is proof of concept, so it does not do any practical thing. It only demostrates process of finding coffee shop in your surroundings to work under great working conditions - silent place, excellent Wifi etc. Coffee shop charges workers by hour. It's good fit for people who don't want to be bound to co-working spaces but does not like working in overcrowded coffee shops.
